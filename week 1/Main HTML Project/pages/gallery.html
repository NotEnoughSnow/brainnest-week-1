    <p> <em>Showcased below are some of the stuff i worked on and finished.
        The descriptions aren't too lengthy because i think art is meant to express itself.</em>

                A commissioned piece. I was requested to merge two cats with two characters from an MMO game (Monster Hunter World).
                Ended up experimenting with new brushes and the results were better than i expected.

                Something i made very early on. Didn't have the best choice for particle effects, but it's still something i would showcase.

                This one mostly came out of a joke between me and my friend. The goal was to draw an F1 track as a female character, emphasising any personality
                traits i could represent based on how the track drives.
                I'll let you guess which track this was.

                A commissioned art piece for a crypto broker.
                Originally, this had more emphasis on bitcoin. But eventually me and my friends took turns changing the picture she's holding.

                One of the first things i drew digitally. There's not really much to it except for all the surprising praise it keeps getting.
